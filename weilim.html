		Hello world!
		Name: Wei Ching Lim
		Thoughts: This Git assignment is not too hard to understand and follow along with the detailed instructions and video tutorial. It is pretty cool and I am starting to get the hang of it. Class is chill but still informative at the same time. Professor is easy going and makes learning these new things less boring.
