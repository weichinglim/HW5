		Hello world!<br>
		Name: Wei Ching Lim<br>
		Thoughts: This Git assignment is not too hard to understand and follow along with the detailed instructions and video tutorial.<br> It is pretty cool and I am starting to get the hang of it. Class is chill but still informative at the same time.<br> Professor is easy going and makes learning these new things less boring.<br>
